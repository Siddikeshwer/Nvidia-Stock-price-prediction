# Nvidia-Stock-price-prediction
The notebook focuses on predicting NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock price movement using a **Random Forest Classifier**. It retrieves historical stock data via `yfinance` and constructs features such as a "Tomorrow" column (next day's closing price) and a binary "Target" column indicating whether the price will rise. The data, starting from 2000, is split into training and test sets, with the last 100 rows reserved for testing. The model is trained using key stock indicators like **Close, Volume, Open, High, and Low prices**. After fitting the model, predictions are made on the test set, and performance is evaluated using a **precision score**. The results are visualized to compare actual vs. predicted trends. While the model provides insights into stock movement, incorporating deep learning methods like LSTMs could enhance predictive accuracy.
